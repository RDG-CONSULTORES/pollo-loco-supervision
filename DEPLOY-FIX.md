# DEPLOY FIX - Manual Upload

Since git push is failing, please manually upload these files to your GitHub repo:

## 1. Replace server-integrated.js with this content:

The file at /Users/robertodavila/pollo-loco-supervision/server-integrated.js has been updated with all fixes.

## 2. Replace app.js with this content:

The file at /Users/robertodavila/pollo-loco-supervision/telegram-bot/web-app/public/app.js has been updated with all fixes.

## 3. Then trigger Manual Deploy in Render

Once these files are uploaded to GitHub, Render will automatically detect the changes and deploy the fixed version.

## Key fixes included:
- Dashboard route conflict resolved (line 83: dashboard-old instead of dashboard)
- Database connection error handling added
- Chart initialization order fixed
- Map double-initialization prevented
- Comprehensive API debugging
- All undefined errors resolved

The server will then show "El Pollo Loco Interactive Dashboard v2.0" instead of "Mini Web App".
